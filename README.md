# ðŸŒ¾ PRBD: Microscopic Images of Different Processed Rice Varieties of Bangladesh

PRBD is a high-resolution microscopic image dataset of 10 different processed rice varieties cultivated in Bangladesh. It is designed for research in **computer vision**, **agriculture**, and **food science**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The goal of PRBD is to enable automated **rice variety recognition**, quality assessment, and analysis using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Researchers can leverage these microscopic images to develop models for food authentication, agricultural research, and smart farming solutions.


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

- **Total Images:** 2,000 original microscopic images  
- **Augmented Images:** 8,000 images (rotations, flips, and other transformations)  
- **Rice Varieties:** 10  
- **Image Type:** High-resolution microscopic images of processed rice

##  Methods / Applications

The dataset can be used for:  
- **Supervised Learning:** Training CNNs (NasNetMobile,ConvNeXt-T,InceptionV3,ResNet50,DenseNet121) for rice variety classification.  
- **Feature Extraction & Embedding:** Using self-supervised learning methods (SimCLR, BYOL) to learn rich features from images.  
- **Quality Assessment:** Automated detection of impurities, broken grains, and size analysis.  



## Example Results

- Models trained on PRBD images can achieve high accuracy in rice variety classification.  
- Self-supervised methods provide robust features that generalize well to unseen rice varieties.  
- Embedding visualization (t-SNE, UMAP) shows clear separability between varieties.



##  Future Work

- Real-time deployment of rice variety recognition systems for factories or mobile devices.  
- Integration with smart agriculture platforms for quality monitoring.  
- Multi-modal analysis combining rice images with other features (e.g., chemical composition, origin) for deeper research.
